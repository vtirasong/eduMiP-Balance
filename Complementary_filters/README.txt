complementary_filters

This project reads the IMU data of the MiP and filters the low
frequency data of the accelerometer as well as the high frequency
data of the gyroscope. This is done by passing the desired data
through a first order low-pass filter (accelerometer) and high-pass
filter (gyroscope).
